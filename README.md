# Long-term Autonomy in the Iribe Glass Hallway
Author: Jingxi Chen (<ianchen@terpmail.umd.edu>)

The goal of this long-term autonomy project is to explore and solve some real-world mobile robotics problems 
(in Perception, SLAM, Planning). 

**Testing Environment:** <br />
The glass hallway in the [Iribe building](https://iribe.umd.edu/#firstPage)' glass hallway at University of Maryland. <br />
The reason we choose this real-world environment is mainly because ***This environment is not designed to be robot-friendly***

The potential research problems/difficulties for mobile robotics:<br />
* The **glass wall** in the hallway 
* This environment is **highly dynamic** (the location of many objects in the evironment can be changed throughout the time)
* There are **human** involved in this environment (people walking around)

## Step 1: Building and testing the research platform
The first step for this project is to select and test a reasonable research platform (mobile robot) that fits to 
our research purpose. 

Our major considerations are: 
* It is compatible with ROS
* Low-cost with reasonable functionality (after some upgrade)
* Medium size 

Based on these criteria, we selected TurtleBot 2 as our base platform.
